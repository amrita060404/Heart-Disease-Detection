#Important Notes:
##Key Dependencies:
Flask for the web framework
scikit-learn for your machine learning model
joblib for loading your pickle files
numpy and pandas for data processing

#Version Pinning:
I've pinned versions that are known to work well together
This ensures consistency across different environments

#Google Colab:
If you used Google Colab for model development, you don't need to include Colab-specific dependencies here since this is for deployment

#Spyder:
Spyder is an IDE and doesn't need to be included in requirements

#Additional Recommendations:
Create a virtual environment before installing these packages
Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt (anaconda suggested me to use conda propmt as -pip would break the dependencies so I did that)

#How to Use This File:
Create a new file named requirements.txt in your project root directory
Copy the content above into it
Commit it to your GitHub repository along with your other files
